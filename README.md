# Navigation of a low speed mobile robot

Navigation algorithm based on [ROS navigation stack](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation) is implemented on a mobile robot with a stereo vision camera as sensor. 
Gazebo is used as the simulation environment and a new robot model was built. Addtional functions including sensor data pre-processing were implemented for the robot to complete the navigation tasks.
